#Password Strength Analyzer
This is currently a locally hosted tool that can be used to verify the strength of any password. The passwords entered are only saved for the session in which the tool is used and are immediately erased from memory for privacy purposes.

##Reasoning:
We live in an era where internet privacy is not as enforced as it should be. I frequently see reports and threads (on Reddit/X) where users mention that their online gaming, professional, and even school accounts have fallen prey to malicious actors. It is often discovered that they had weak, suggested, or self-created passwords. Additionally, society is regressing to a mindset where many people no longer care about their online security (e.g., "Companies and bad actors already have my information" or "If you use these apps/services, your personal information is already owned by someone else").

I'm working on streamlining the process so that future iterations require less effort from the user.

The next iteration of this tool is to create a .dmg/.exe file to develop an application with the exact same functionality.
