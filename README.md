# Password Strength Analyzer
This is a currently a local-hosted tool which can be used to verify the strength of any password. The password entered are only saved for the session in which the tool is called and are immediately erased from memory for privacy purposea

## Reasoning:
We live in an era in which internet privacy is not as enforced as it should be. I frequently see reports and threads (on Reddit/X) regarding users mentioning their online gaming, professional, and even school accounts are prey to malicious actors and it's later found out that they had weak suggested or created passwords. It also doesn't help how society is regressing to a mindset where they don't really care too much about what goes online ("So and So companies/actors already have my information", "If you already use these apps/services, your personal information is already owneed by someone else") 

Please view the readme file prior to running the script - I'm working on streamlining the process so future iterations take less work on the user

The next iteration of this tool is to create a .dmg/.exe to create an app which has the exact same functionality
